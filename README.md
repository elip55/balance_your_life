I found myself doing math on a paper one day and thought "wait a second...i know how to code"

Super simple program to help me do what i do with a pencil and paper every month. 

I utalize a local .csv file to update the amounts of each account. 


# THE CURRENT FORMAT OF THE CSV FORMAT IS AS FOLLOWS:
# CHECKING, BALANCE,0
# ACCOUNT1, BALANCE1, MINPAYMENT1
# ACCOUNT2, BALANCE2, MINPAYMENT2
# ACCOUNTn, BALANCEn, MINPAYMENTn
